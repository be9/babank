### Babank

Babank is an implementation of a "Bank" API specified in [this document](https://github.com/be9/babank/blob/master/build_a_bank.md).
Pronounce it as "baBANG".

### Installation and Usage

It's a Rails app and can be easily deployed to e.g. Heroku. Here's my [deployed version](https://babank-for-plaid.herokuapp.com/).

The app provides a bunch of API endpoints (`/api/1/...`) and a [documentation page](https://babank-for-plaid.herokuapp.com/) which details their usage.
